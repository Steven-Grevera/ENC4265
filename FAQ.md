# Assignment Details 

### Prompt O 

Make an FAQ page for your website! This used to be a deliverable, but it was replaced by the Chatbot assignment. You can still find the instructions here.

What is Due
Submit a direct link to a separate page on your website that includes the following:
* An FAQ page for a complex product or platform
* Clearly organized by topic, problem, customer, or whatever makes sense
* This should not be alphabetical order
* There should be category headings that group questions on similar topics
* There should be at least 3 categories
* Questions should be in question format: properly capitalized, and punctuated
* There should be at least 3 questions in each category
* Questions should display the actual, correct information for the answers
* A search bar
* Instructions for Wix and WordPress are in this module.
* Please contact me before the deadline if you are unable to figure out how to add the search bar
 
Tips
* Think carefully about the broadest range of users this product may have, and put yourself in their position:
* What will they want to know?
* What will they need to know to successfully use the product?
* What kinds of words will they think to search for?
* It may help to think of categories and then brainstorm questions that fit within them; conversely, it might help to think of questions then look for connections for categories - decide which option is best for you and your product.
* I suggest selecting a product that you either know extremely well OR one that you don't know much about. Like the category brainstorming, some people will have an easier time with one or the other of these approaches. Role play a novice user, an advanced user, and a curious visitor who stumbled upon the product and is just plain curious.
* Wix has an FAQ plugin that creates collapsible answer text and supports the use of categories. I have permission from a former student to share their procedure video for how to use the Wix plugin (click here)Links to an external site..
