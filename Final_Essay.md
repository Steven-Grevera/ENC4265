At the start of this year I took a technical writing class that completely changed my skillsets entirely. I thought I could never code, never work with these things or even learn them. Through hard work and Ms Johnson’s class I was able to not only do the basics but excel beyond. 

Through the course I learned many elaborate methods and ways to use the markdown coding language. As a writer myself, the language is very intuitive and also powerful. It was written by writers, for writers it feels like and thanks to it, I can bring my documents to web pages at a much more presentable format then just offering people word documents and the like. I now have tangible means to present documents to people without the need of documents at all, aside for myself for the means of storage… for now.

The class itself was a little rough as I went from zero coding knowledge, to realizing that some aspects of Markdown I already knew. I use applications like Discord and other online means of communication and Markdown uses various versions of those applications in it’s own language. So I was shocked to find that using stars to enclose text would actually do something markdown! It wasn’t exactly the same as Discord but it was a starting point. Once I understood that, I would only go on from there. 

Even so, while many things were very helpful in the class, I feel there was a lot of things that could have been said that weren’t. There was many a moment where I would spend a long period of time trying to figure something out or even wonder if something was outright possible. In the end I would get those answers and I’m glad I was able to find them. In the moment however, they were frustrating. Tests of character for sure. 

Thanks to this course, my goals in life have been skyrocketed. Markdown and Github Pages allow you to essentially create free websites. In today’s day and age, that’s a game changer. Finally, without a massive issue or free, in the future, I can and will make my own website to make me stand out amongst the crowd. Moreover, I can now highlight direct projects as work for people to look at and see what I’ve done in my time as a writer, rather then just have things as documents. I can shock and awe, like the intent was for example with my large scale manual project in the course. 

The idea behind my manual was a simple perfect opportunity. Shadow Corridor 2 is a video game I enjoy. However whenever I look up information on it, none can be found or exists. That’s because most of it’s audience is Japanese. By creating an English website for users to in the future to use, I could change the entire landscape for this game’s community going forward. I will do so, in fact. Or at least be a noted part of it’s history. 

With that, I can use it forever as an example of “what I’m capable of”. Showing potential employers what I can achieve in a mere two weeks. If people need a “manual”/guide making guy, I’m that guy. Any technical documents in fact, I can and will be that guy. All of it, in large part, due to this class.
