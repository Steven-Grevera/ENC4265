# Shadow Corridor 2: An English Guide To The Japanese Mythology Maze


# Introduction

Shadow Corridor 2 is a maze style horror game in which you are given a set predetermined theme, which your “level”, or rather, “corridor”, in this sense. Each “corridor”, is procedurally generated upon level selection based upon a seed which will ensure that each and every experience you have is unique. The layout learned from one session, will not be the same layout for the next even if they are the same corridor and vice versa. 
 
Amo No Yohira is the spiritual land in which you find yourself, a world of the dead and a world of corrupted infesting water. Beware the water while your journey takes place here, lest you come to regret it. 
 
Your purpose in each corridor is the find an item known as Magatamas, which are green jade like objects that serve as “keys” to escape the maze. Your difficulty will determine if how many you need to escape, scaling from 3-5. Upon obtaining the required Magatamas, you can then escape the level by finding the generated exit which is never in the same place. Using a type of guide doll or a compass to help you find this exit as well. Keeping track of your progress through the use of glowing stones and your own mental notes as you progress through the maze.

 
Shadow Corridor 2 has a large fanbase primarily situated in Japan, yet many English players have also began to play and enjoy the game. However, when looking up information about the game online, most of that information is in Japanese or translated very poorly into English. This guide aims to solve that issue by establishing that information firmly into proper English words and instructions. 

The purpose of this guide is to provide a clear and concise means and method to playing the game: Shadow Corridor 2. While the game is English dubbed and even translated fairly well in the game itself, many aspects of the game reveal themselves to you over a long period of time. By reading ahead in this guide, you can save a run of a level and ultimately end up saving hours of work.

# Game Options 

## Keyboard and Mouse or Controller Support

If you are using the Steam Version of Shadow Corridor 2, you have the option of using Keyboard and Mouse and binding all your keys to your keyboard, or using a Steam supported controller type of your choice, such as the Duel Shock 4 controllers or an Xbox One style controller. This will be automatically detected upon your launching of the game. 

If you are using Nintendo Switch, you will use the Switch based controllers or console buttons provided to you as your only option at this time. 


 
## Game Settings
 

A series of options will be present in this tab and will each have different effects to your experience with the game. 

Language: Sets the language of the text from it’s choice selection. All dubbing is done exclusively in Japanese. 

Display Timer: When you are in a level, this option being enabled will allow you to see your time always displayed while playing in the mission itself. (Add a picture here to show that fact.)

Item Inventory Display Time: The total number (in seconds) that the inventory will be displayed when expanded before it automatically closes itself. 

Display Item Info: This option will display item info when you highlight an item, such as a the firecrackers for example, to provide a tooltip which will provide a general idea of what the item in question does. Toggling to off or on based your preference.

Look When Using Compass: As you traverse your generated corridor, you may run across an item called a compass. (Read more on that here- **(Link here later))** If this option is disabled, then you cannot move and look at the compass at the same time. Having this enabled allows you to do so. This is for people who may find this as a distraction. 

Return To Base Immediately After Results: If this option is set to on, then upon completing a level, you will be sent back to the “hub” of the game. See more on this here: **(Link to hub section later)**

Vision Shake From Walking: This option will determine if your vision shakes from walking or not. For immersive experiences, this should be turned on. For those with motion sickness or who dislike this visual effect, keeping it off will ensure this does not occur. 

Controller Vibration: If your controller is in use, having this option set to on will result in certain in game events causing your controller to shake, such as when a Wanderer (the enemy monsters in the game-) approach you. **(See more on monsters here (Link here later)**

The Shaking of The Flashlight: With this option set to true, when you use your flashlight item, it will shake as you run as opposed to staying sturdy to light up areas. This option will provide a more immersive experience for those who want “realism” in their experiences. 

Whispers of The Remains: When collecting “souls” **(more on this later, (link here))**, you will hear an audio sound effect when picking them off of skeleton bodies. Having this option off will display this effect, for those who want to focus more on the sound of possible Apparitions instead. 




 
## Control Settings
 
A series of options will be present in this tab and will each have different effects to how your controller/mouse/keyboard operates and feels. 

Look Sensitivity Mouse: Exclusively for Keyboard and Mouse Users, this option determines the sensitivity when looking around in your first person perspective with the mouse.

Look Sensitivity Controller: Exclusively for Controller Users, this option determines the sensitivity when looking around in your first person perspective with a controller.

Invert Horizontal Look Axis: Having this option on will reverse your movements of right and right with your desired control type. So left will go right and right left and vice versa. 

Invert Vertical Look Axis: Having this option on will reverse your movements of up and down looking with your desired control type. So up will go down and down will go up and vice versa. 

Crouch Control Type: Your options being “Trigger” or “Hold” will determine if you want to hold down your crouch key or simply press the button to toggle between crouching or standing. 

Spring (Sprint) Ground Type: Is currently a misspelled option, which is meant to say (Sprint) Ground Type. Your options being “Trigger” or “Hold” will determine if you want to hold down your sprint key or simply press the button to toggle between sprinting and walking.

Aim Assist Shooting: Currently will lock certain items that require pointing at apparitions just by aiming them down, such as the revolver pistol item.   

Aim Assist Interaction: This option will lock your interaction within a certain radius with doors or trigger fires from the revolver pistol. 

 
## Control Assignments 
 
 
In this section for keyboard and mouse will be a series of keybindings or mouse interactions that will activate the given action in the scenario’s they list. The top being Mouse and Keyboard Settings and below it being Gamepad settings, showing you what buttons on your controller or gamepad and what they do. 

 

## Graphics Settings 
 

This tab is all about graphical settings for the game itself and will do various graphical things for the game itself. Options in here will mostly effect your visuals in game and be effected by your Graphics Card in your PC or system device. 

Brightness: Determines how bright the actual in game world will be. 5 is the lowest setting and 20 is the highest. 

Window Mode: Determines how the game will be played, allowing you to window, window a simulated fullscreen mode or to run the game in fullscreen mode. Windowed modes may take away from immersion but allow for easy tabbing in and out of the game. 

Resolution: Determines your screen resolution for the program itself. 

Indirect Lightning Quality: Determines lightning that is further away or possibly through reflective surfaces. Setting this to 0 will increase performance but lower graphical fidelity. 

Reflection Quality: Determines the quality and fidelity toward real reflective surfaces such as mirror and glass, as well as even water surfaces in game. Lowering the option will increase performance.   

Level of Shadow Depiction: Determines the detail and graphical fidelity of shadows in game cast about by objects and apparitions. Lowering the option will increase performance.  

Bloom: Bloom is a means to simulate light artifacting through a camera lens as opposed more specifically to what a human themselves might see. 

Motion Blur: Determines if motion blur will be used with movement in the game. Those for a more immersive experience can keep this on and those who wish to avoid any possible motion sickness issues can turn this off. 

Fish Eye Lens: A fish eyes lens effect is a panoramic type of view and can essentially transcend standard monitor images. Having this option on will only show an effect is a panoramic supporting device is used. 

FPS Cap: Setting an option value here will limit FPS of the game to a certain value. Setting it to off will allow it to run without a cap. Setting FPS caps can improve performance if performance issues arise. Or if a preferred FPS is desired to be experienced without any deviations.
 
## Sound Settings
 

In this tab you will find various audio levels for different sets of sounds and the levels in which they will be heard from.

Master Volume: Determines the level of all sounds overall. 

BGM: The music volume for the main menu or cinematics. 

Corridor BGM: Determines music specifically when in Corridors (this includes Hub Sections). 

Sound Effects: This determines the volume of all sounds made by items, apparitions and miscellaneous sounds that may occur. 

Voice: Determines the voice for certain speaking apparitions but is mostly used as dialogue for cinematics or interactions with characters.

Footsteps: Determines the sound of your footsteps in game if you wish to hear them. 

Environmental Sounds: This value determines the atmospheric sounds  that can exist in corridors such as water style effects in levels that exist with them. 
 
# General Game Mechanics
 
In order to survive traversing the corridors of this game, you must manage a series of survival mechanisms built into the game in order to succeed. These all must be managed successfully or else you could end up with a game over. Resulting in you having to generating a new level of the corridor and having to rediscover a brand new layout from scratch. 


 
## Lives (Candle’s Lit)
 
Once you find yourself in the level of a corridor, the candles will appear in the circled location of your screen at the top left. These candles indicate your lives. When you run out, you will obtain a “Game Over” and be given the option to “retry” which will allow you to generate a brand new level of that corridor or “Return to Base” which will take you back to your Hub. 

With a series of two items that can be found while exploring the corridors, you may find an extra life. Restoring one of your extinguished candles. 

**Note: You need all your candles to survive. Losing your third and final candle, is a Game Over. You have 3 lives total and 0 in this context is counted as “Dead”.**
 
  



## Health
 
Next to the candles on the right side is a bar with a value of 100/100. The number on the left is your current health and the number on the right side is your maximum total health you can have. If your health on the left side reaches “0”, you will lose a candle and if you run out of candles, you will obtain a “Game Over” as a failure condition. 

Several items can restore health as well as certain Karuta (Link) and even coffee effects (Link) to try and keep you alive. You can even increase your maximum health by finding a special well/pool room found in your journeys, increasing your max health to 130 at the cost of 1500 souls. (Link)


## Stamina
 
Stamina is used to sprint in the game and allows for running if being chased or just traversing things faster. Stamina can be increased in it’s regeneration rate, never in it’s maximum amount. Using coffee, karuta and some passive items. 

## Magatama Total
 
To the right of your candles and right below your health bar is the total amount of Magatama you have in your current level’s session. As you pick one up, you will obtain a green glowing orb in the orbs listed in that section. If you play at higher levels, this count of three can raise to 5. You must have all orbs glowing green in order to properly use the levels exit. 



 

 
  
 

## Souls: 
 
Souls are the currency of the corridors. You can use souls for various things, such as karuta effects such as the map which will drain them constantly. Items from the Butterfly Shop (Link), helpful corridor rooms (link) and for things such as the Butterfly Lantern Light Source (Link). 

Souls are obtained through checking resource gathering spots, which are specific and designated in design based on the corridor typing. 
 
Or by finding skeleton’s in hallways or rooms, which can appear within any corridor. 

 

Interacting with either of these objects, will net the player a number of souls. The number obtained for the player can be upgraded with certain karuta for those who want to play with a heavy souls earning potential build. 

## Items
 
Items are placed within the section circled and this section will display your max inventory size. By pressing your destinated inventory button, you can open this menu to look as the image above does, though yours might appear smaller in slots. That is due to the fact that in the image above, a karuta is being used which increases the total amount of inventory slots you have for unique items. 

Items have a set number that can be picked up. For example, glowing stones cap at under normal circumstances at 20 stones. You can not duplicate an item beyond that cap into a second slot. Each slot is for unique items only. However, with a karuta, you can increase the cap of held number of the item in question by a set amount that is varied by that item type. 

For more information on all items in Shadow Corridor 2, click here (Link). 


## Passive Items
 
Passive items are held items that you hold on your left side of your inventory that have various effects. Such as Insect Repellent, which makes it so insect based Pests cannot deal damage to the player, or will even be alerted to their presence.

Passive items are used up without a button needing to be pressed, which will be indicated by a Grey Bar outlining the passive items uses. Some items will activate a single time, such as the charm item shown above, when the player is grabbed, teleporting them away. 

With the right karuta, a player may hold up to 2 passive items at any given time. Allowing for more effects to be active at once. 

For more information about the existing passive items in Shadow Corridor 2, see the following section: (Link) 


## Light Source Items
 

Light Source items are various items that provide light source in an area but may also have other effects. In Shadow Corridor 2, you always start with an infinite basic light source in the “Lighter”, which is obtained at the start of the game and exists no matter what. It cannot be replaced. 

 

When a light source is on, not only will a room get brighter, it may have an effect. You can see this item is “on” based on the small sun icon beneath the light source item itself. Some light sources are stronger then others in terms of “brightness”, for example, the flashlight being stronger in directed light then the lighter. However, more light makes it easier for apparitions to find the player and is one of the easiest ways to get spotted. 

For more specifics on Light Source items, see: (Link) 

 



## Corruption 
 
Corruption builds up with exposure to water in Shadow Corridor 2, as The Shadow Corridor’s are part of a larger realm of the dead. Water applies to things such as “Swamps” which can spawn randomly in the world or as specific parts of specific corridor types. Another type of “water” that can fill this gauge is “rain”. This rain will build up corruption. 

On deluge difficulty, this water will bombard you and be even more deadly in all of it’s forms as well. 

If corruption reaches it’s max possible allocation, it will cause an instant life to be lost or if it’s your last life, a game over. 

Using certain karuta can allow for corruption to be negated through the use of passive items that can be obtained at the start of your level’s session, or certain coffee effects can also be utilized to lower the rate in which corruption builds.  

On most difficulties other then deluge, the best way to get rid of corruption entirely is to walk over to a skeleton’s remains. Flowers growing out of it will drain your corruption bar until it is entirely free. Making skeletons good to seek out in corridors with heavy amounts of swamp and rain. 

**Will Get images of a swamp and rain descending on a player. Maybe even an image of the boss escape run level as well perhaps. As well as the actual bar.**


 
## Insanity 
 
Insanity is a yellow bar that will fill up far rarer then corruption. It is caused by being in proximity to certain apparitions or environmental factors that can be triggered in the corridors. 

When insanity is built up to max, you will be stunned in place and let out a loud scream. Alerting apparitions to your location or if you were in a chase, causing you usually to get caught if you don’t break out of it fast enough. By clicking on the indicated button fast, you can break the stun faster. You will also take health damage while in this state. 

 
## Hiding Places
 
Throughout the corridors, you will find places that you can hide in if an Apparition is on your tail or nearby. These places of protection must be found in order to avoid being discovered and if you have your light source on without the right karuta on, you can still be discovered. So it’s best to keep that off. All corridors have different types of hiding places that can range from closets to tiny baskets, all depending on the corridor in which you find yourself exploring. 
 
  
#The Hub
 

After getting through the games intro, you will arrive at the hub. In the hub will be several options that will assist you on your corridor explorations. 

## Hub Music Control
 

By interacting with this device while in the hub, you can cycle through a series of soundtracks in the game itself. Pick your favorite one! Feel free to change it at any time by coming to this location. 


 
# Karuta Cards
 

Karuta Cards are benefits that you bring into your corridor explorations that all have different benefits and effects. One such example is above. Gamers with experience with other games, might call these “Perks”. 

Karuta are one of Shadow Corridor 2’s most powerful benefits as they can completely change your experience while exploring corridors as their effects can be extremely powerful and dynamically change aspects of the game in some way. They can vary from things like using a special map that can help you navigate, to simple but powerful buffs like stat resistances to certain negative traits you can run into while exploring, such as Corruption. 

 

Karuta are limited to 5 total by the end game of Shadow Corridor 2, with an extra slot possible if found in a level itself for a price. 

To select you Karuta loadout at The Hub, come to this location listed below and interact with the table.
 

## Sealed Karuta Cards
 
 
Corrupted  Human’s or Impure look like the above and if they grab you, they will hold onto you for a bit and they will then seal a karuta card at random. Some karuta can protect this sealing effect from occurring but so too can certain coffee effects. (See coffee below **(Link Later)**. **Note as well that while grabbed, you can still be harmed by hostile apparitions. You will also take health damage from the grab itself.** 

 

The only way to unseal karuta is to spend 1000 souls at the butterfly shop, which is randomly located in each corridor. Spending the 1000 souls will unseal all karuta at once for the exact same price, meaning in some situations it might be better to wait for more to be sealed before spending your souls while out exploring. 
 


## Bonus Karuta Slot
 
While exploring in Corridors, you may find a Karuta card table. By spending 1500 at these randomly generated locations, you will unlock an additional Karuta slot for the rest of that corridors exploration and it will be lost on it’s completion or a game over while exploring. 

The bonus karuta card gained is completely up to you to choose from and will bring up your menu of existing cards accordingly. While looking through your cards, the game is paused and so is the corridor timer. So take as long as you need!

 
 
 
 



## Buying More Karuta

 

Karuta are bought with Magatama, which you obtain 1 of per your explorations outside of the hub in corridors itself. You do not have to complete an exploration in full of a corridor or even finish a session to obtain this currency to spend. The moment you pick one up in a corridor, it is added to your inventory. 

To buy Karuta, talk to the barkeep and select the “Buy Karuta” option. 

 

5 total options will be displayed at a single time and to refresh your options, you must spend a Magatama. When a Karuta card is bought, a new one is not added. 

Any time the game is loaded or a corridor exploration ends and you load back into the hub world, your options offered will refresh free of charge.

# Coffee 

 
 

Coffee provides smaller but helpful benefits to the player at a selection of 1 of each. Unlocking other coffee requires Coffee Bean Bags which can be found while exploring corridors. 
 

Collecting a coffee bean bag while exploring corridors, regardless of if you complete it to it’s exit or get a “game over”, keeps the bean forever in your amount collected total. Each corridor can only have a set amount collected within it maximum, before they no longer count toward your grand total. This amount can be seen on the corridor level selection screen.
 
To access the coffee menu, select the clipboard menu on the table from the above image **(Label figure properly later for referencing-)**  and you will be greeted to a selection of options. 

 

Selecting an option will cause your character to drink some coffee as an animation and give you the coffee benefit that you selected. Please note that as well that using a coffee item despite it’s numerical “cost” does not actually use any beans and is more so an unlock requirement, not a “cost”.

| Coffee Name | Coffee Bean Unlock Amount | 		Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Week Coffee | 	Basic Unlock | 	The amount of souls acquired increases slightly. (The increase is about 10%) | 
| Cafe au Lait | 	10 Coffee Beans | 	The effect on the Apparitions hearing and vision is slightly reduced. (The heartbeat and blinking sound while running are not noticeable even if you switch to walking.) |

# The Shadow Corridors (Generated Maze Levels)
 

To select a corridor to play through, open a door toward the back of the bar on your right and then walk up to a well with the stone carving of a snail’s face and eyes. 

Look into the water section of this well and hit the interact button to access the list of corridors to choose from. 

The moment your corridor is generated and loaded and you confirm you are ready with the destinated key, you will enter the corridor’s spawn point, which is usually fixed in it’s typing. It’s location within the larger level of the corridor however, is not fixed and could be near the exit, or far. A timer has also begun which keeps track of your time spent in the level. 

To complete a corridor level, you must successfully collect 3 or 5 Magatama depending on your difficulty choice. Then, you must find the exit of the level to successfully complete the corridor. 

If you fail to exit the level and run out of lives, all of your progress in that generated level of the corridor will be lost and you will be returned to the hub, or you may retry. Depending on which you may rather do. 

**(LATER WILL HAVE EACH LEVEL LISTED BELOW, NEED PICTURES)**  



## Difficulty 
 
Shadow Corridor 2’s difficulty levels are fairly straightforward and pretty well kept to their names. However, much of what is changed isn’t clear until you play the game at higher levels and by then, you may have forgotten how you started. If you are new to the Shadow Corridor franchise, or maze style games in general, you should certainly pick Beginner. 
 
### Beginner 

- The easiest way to play the game. In total you must obtain three magatama . 
- Items spawn in great quantity. 

- The running speed of Apparitions is slower and the distance that they chase is much shorter then higher levels. 

- It takes a longer period of time for Apparitions to break down doors when in pursuit. 

- Apparitions detection of sound is very low

- Karuta being sealed is very low. 

- Levels are smaller in size that other levels

- The number of pests is very low. 

- There is less rain dripping ceiling locations.

- Corruption buildup is very slow. 

- Damage is halved. 

- At the start of the game, magatama rooms are not always locked and can be just open without the need of a key. 

- All Trap Room Magatama rooms are unlocked.

- Gimmick usually only occurs once in most maps. 
 
### Intermediate 

- A more average experience, preparing you for harder difficulties of the game. The number of magatama collected is set to 5, as opposed to 3. 

- There are still many items.

- The running speed of Apparitions is more accurate to their true speeds and you must shake them off more efficiently as a result. 

- The detection of which they can hear you is increased from beginner but still not too intense. About the range of your heartbeat and slightly beyond. If you can see flashing lights, they can hear you if you make loud sounds.

- You are more likely to have your karuta sealed if you’re grabbed by a Corrupted Human. 

- The map is larger. 

- There still remain a lower number of pests. 

- There is a slightly higher amount of rain dripping ceiling locations. 

- The corruption accumulation is higher and will become far more of a factor.

- Magatama Trap Rooms are now locked properly like other rooms, aside from in rarer instances toward the starting levels of the game.

- The stage gimmick can occur twice. After picking up your 3rd Magatama and your 5th and final. 

### Advanced

- Your built up skills at this point will be tested to your known limits in this difficulty. 

- There are far more Apparitions that can and will spawn. 

- Wandering Shion can patrol the hallways in rare circumstances. 

- Item counts are much smaller then previously. 

- The time if takes an Apparition to break down doors is decreased by a large amount. 

- The range in which an Apparition can hear you is greatly increased. 

- Corrupted Humans will almost always seal karuta if you are grabbed without any assistance.

- The map is even larger then previous difficulties, making for longer amounts of time exploring.

- There are a lot of pests now.

- There are many leaking ceiling locations throughout the corridors.

- The corruption builds up faster then Intermediate. 

- All Magatama Rooms are closed except the Mayubo room. However, after The Shrine level, these rooms also become locked as well. 

- The stage gimmick is activated each time you obtain a magatama, and the range of the stage gimmick increases slightly. 
 

### Deluge 

- The hardest difficulty in Shadow Corridor 2, this will break you and force you to escape your comfort zones. 

- Initially only one Candle Light (Life Point) is lit, however, if you find other candles throughout the corridor’s exploration, you can increase this up to a maximum of three.

- From the beginning, enemies that wouldn’t usually appear now will do so, such as more unique ones such as the Mizuchi Apparition

- There are many Apparitions in a large quantity. 

- There are a lot of pests.

- The number of leaking ceiling locations is extremely high. You will deal with corruption.

- When the soul is retrieved from the corpse, the four petals wither and the corpse is no longer able to purify corruption.

- Normal magatama is replaced with corrupted magatama that when picked up, will increase your buildup or start it. It will also continue to build up for 30 seconds after picking one up after the initial pick up.

- There is a 35% chance upon picking up a magatama that a karuta will also be sealed.

- If you are grabbed by a corrupted human, you are guaranteed to have a karuta sealed, no matter what resistances you have.

- Magatama rooms spawn in less frequency. 

- Trauma will appear after you collect 5 Magatama in each corridor. This will not double for Sea of Reminiscence however.

- The range of stage gimmicks is increased further slightly
 

## Light Markers
 
Across your designated corridor’s level, you might find various forms of interactable light sources. Turning these one will mark the area as explored by you and provide you with higher visibility in the area. However, what provides you with better visibility, may also provide the apparitions with higher visibility as well depending on the corridor 2. So keep this in my when deciding which lights to turn on.

## Trapdoors 
 
Trapdoors will spawn in the ground in rare occasions which lead to linked locations. If you walk over one twice, you will fall through. However, if you walk over it once while being pursued by an Apparition, the Apparition that walks over it will fall through the trapdoor, saving you from the chase. If you fall through yourself, you will be teleported to the corresponding location connected with the trapdoor around the corridor which is randomly generated. However, an Apparition that falls through will simply despawn. 

   


# Special Rooms

Across the levels you explore amongst the corridors, you will encounter special variances to the usual layouts. These special rooms have a purpose to them or will stand out with a purpose to you in some way. They generate randomly and some only appear in certain corridor types, for example, the swamp appearing more so in The Shrine then the first level. Though a variant of the swamp can appear as The Swamp Trap for the Magatama Room. (Link here.)

 




## Extra Life (Candle) Rooms 
 
These exist as two different parts, a section which contains a buyable candle for 1500 souls. (3000 in Marathon.) 

Then the second part is the actual shrine in which you place the candle. In placing the candle, you will obtain a new life if you had a candle extinguished.

 

 


## Doll Rooms
 
For the price of 1500 souls, you can buy this Doll, which will spawn onto the ground nearby. The doll will then upon being interacted with, wind up and will start to head in the direction of the levels exist. Serving as a guide to the exit for you. 

While you are within a certain range of the doll, due to the flower in which it is holding, you will be cleansed of all corruption buildup, allowing it to be used as a mobile safe hub from corruption all the way to the exit. 

For 800 souls instead, you can use one of your karuta card slots to spawn this same doll anywhere by inputting a button combination. This can also help with corruption if you are near full corruption build up. You must select this card at the start of the game or as an extra slotted card if you can find the table. 

 
  


## Extra Health Well Rooms
 
For the price of 1000 souls, upon finding this well in a room, you can add 30 additional maximum health to your character for the duration of that level’s journey permanently. This effect persists even through death but does not persist beyond an exit/completion of a level, or a “Game Over”. 

 
 


## Swamps
 
Swamps don’t spawn on every corridor unless it is at the higher difficulties for the “Swamp Trap” Magatama rooms. The swamps when walked in will slow down the player’s movement drastically and also build up corruption at a fast rate. Traversing these could be extremely dangerous as a result. 

Apparitions are not slowed by these unlike the player so if being chased by one, factor this into your decision making when choosing to traverse one. 

   


## The Butterfly Shop
 
The Butterfly Shop is owned by The Shopkeeper: Hotariya and has two means to get to it, which are mirrors which are randomly generated throughout the level of the corridor that your within. 

A good way to indicate that your are approaching a mirror entrance to the shop, is hearing the sound of a toybox’s music playing. This music indicates that you are approaching a mirror whether behind a locked door or located somewhere within the level. 

 

Upon interacting with the mirror, the player can then teleport into a Butterfly Shop Hub, which consists of the mirror you used to reach it’s location and another to another location somewhere else in the level. If you look into the mirror before teleporting back from the shop, you can usually see the state it’s in. If you see flashing lights, this is a good indication that apparitions are nearby and you may want to consider waiting to teleport to that area. 

 

The Shopkeeper sells items for souls that range from items, passives, a single buyable coffee bean bag for the collection or archives. The Shopkeepers stock of an item is not unlimited and in the case of the coffee bean and the archive collectible, these can only be bought once in your save file per corridor. Whereas other items refresh on returns to the corridor after you escape or obtain a “Game Over” and generate a new one. 



 

By spending a certain amount of souls, the shop keeper will reward you with special karuta items over time and these do not have to be spent all at once and serve as a tracking across your save file. 

 
 

# Corridor Items
 
Corridor items are items that you pick up while exploring the level of a corridor. Certain karuta cards allow you to start with specific items to achieve purposes. Items can be used for a variety of purposes such as restoring health and stamina, scaring away apparitions, pests or drawing their attention somewhere else. Some are used to mark areas of the map or light up the map as a light source. Whereas others can be used to combat apparitions directly through the use of stunning or outright forced removal with the right item in hand. 

Items are collected by opening up drawers scattered throughout the corridor levels in the form usually of desks and tables and are always indoors on levels that have an outside and inside. 

The Compass item is a unique item that spawns at a very rare chance from drawers and when found, will display the exit’s location, guiding the player to the means of escape.


 
 
When picking up items as well, there is a chance for you to be jumped by spiders as a “trap” that will do damage to you. This can also result sometimes in a karuta being sealed. The way to tell if it’s a trap or not, is the drawer should slightly open but not all the way and seem to get “stuck.” This will tell you the drawer is a trap. You can open it again to take damage and there will usually be an item inside. Giving you the choice: Some of your health and a karuta sealing chance for an item, or ignore it.

# Apparitions (Enemies)
 
Apparitions are wandering enemies that will usually proceed to extinguish a life should the player be caught by them regardless of health value.. All Apparitions behave differently and have unique characteristics. Some are even unique to specific corridors themselves or specific difficulties of those corridors. 

To avoid an Apparition, players need to hide without any light sources in the corridors safe hiding zone which will change it’s appearance and type each corridor type. Some may be closets, some may be small baskets. If an Apparition finds you while you are hiding within a hiding spot due to unfortunate circumstances, you will lose a life regardless of health value. 

Apparitions spawn based on the location of the player as well as how fast they are moving through the corridor and the amount of noise they are making. Once and Apparition is spawned, usually near the player, they will track the player by those noises and lights that they are using. By using things like Butterfly Lanterns, they can appear mostly invisible to Apparitions’s, albeit unless they get close enough to the player. 

There are two key indicators to know that an apparition is nearby. One of the easiest to hear will be two distinct sounds. You will start to hear your own heartbeat, for starters. Then the second, will proceed to be a unique sound to that entity itself. These sounds could be bells for the dancers or screams for the monsters. The other indicator is flickering light sources. If a light source is flickering, it means that you should find shelter. As not all entities use sound and your only means of knowing one is present is your heartbeat or the light sources flickering. 

When you are discovered, a red light will beam out of the Apparition and they will pursue you. Until that red light disappears, you are in “pursuit” and if they catch you, it’s a life lost, or a game over if it’s your last one. 

If you are being chased by an Apparition and you close a door behind yourself, depending on the Apparition in question, they will begin to bang on the door you closed on them as if it was locked. After a certain amount of hits they will break through and continue to chase you. Allowing you to use doors as a means to buy you time should you be pursued. 


 
## Apparition Types
Teru teru bōzu (Screaming Dolls)
 
Apparitions which are covered in branded white cloth covering their faces. Their lower body of “feet” are hands and can be identified from far distances due to their loud screaming and constantly shaking speed of their limbs. They cannot hear sounds due to how loud they are and so are not prone to sounds other then firecrackers. They also only ever look in front of themselves and will not look behind unless they turn their entire bodies around. 
 
### Teru teru bōzu destroy doors extremely fast and on the higher levels, destroy doors instantly. They will destroy doors even if they haven’t spotted you sometimes. This is not cause for panic if you are not being chased, simply duck into cover and wait for their business to conclude. 

 

If being chased by a Teru teru bōzu, try to find a trap door fast as they are extremely fast and without items to stun them, you will be in great trouble without the ability to block them with doors. 

Outside of the game, Teru teru bōzu is a Japanese doll tradition involving the creation of a handmade doll, often made of paper or cloth, that is hung outside to bring sunny weather and ward off rain. As this game is about “rain” and “water” in relation together with the spirt world and death, this is their take on that tradition. 
 

### Whirlpool Dancer (Kagura suzu)
 
 

The Whirlpool Dancer will first be heard by their ringing bells, which are Kagura suzu, a traditional Shinto instrument that is meant to entertain the Gods and worn by forms of priest traditional uses. The Dancer is an old man in a mask in appearance. 

 
The Whirlpool Dancer has a full 360 degree vision, is it is advised not to try and sneak up behind them and to stay calm, quiet and in the darkness. At the bare minimum, use light sources they cannot see for themselves, such as The Butterfly Lantern, to avoid detection. They can hear you and can even sometimes find you even if you are crouched, so it is best to hide to the best of your ability and preferably in a “hiding place” as opposed to out in the open.
 
 

### Shion (Snail/Slug Monster)
 
The Shion is constantly crying and whimpering, usually in place in it’s most common form. Rarely, it can wonder the halls as a wandering form, that acts just like the stationary form but actually moves it’s locations. As it is blind, it won’t react to your flashlight or any other light sources which you may turn on. 

 
The Shion is entirely blind but on higher level difficulties, can sense your presence if you get too close. From a large radius, it can sense your movements, on the higher difficulties even something as simple as walking normally, will trigger this Apparitions attention and they will come to verify and check where you are. If you run while in the radius of these Apparitions, you will initiate a chase and these entities are extremely fast. Your only hope of escaping one is to quickly use a firecracker to cover your own movements and flee as far and fast as you can. You’ll likely need to throw several firecrackers at higher levels behind yourself, to keep it’s attention drawn just long enough to lose it. 

 
The Shion naming is due to the flowers which grow out of it’s head in some ways, though these flowers have the same effects of Hydrangea Flowers and will actually cleanse your corruption within a certain radius for the player. These flowers are called: Aster tataricus, or the word “Shion” in Japanese. Which means in the language of flowers: “I won’t forget you.” Implying that perhaps the apparition crying, is due to being forgotten. Alternatively It can also be interpreted that the name “Shion” in Japanese for females, is a name which means “A person who remembers, one who does not forget.” Which could explain why they are crying, for they remember something horrible and it torments them, based on the trauma apparition, this is likely another hint at the linkage to the main character. Shion can also mean “Purple Garden.”. Which relates to the flowers and colorations on them. All of these things, can be true at once and lead to the Apparition you see before you and could explain why the character even has some resemblance to the main character. 

### Mizuchi (Snake Woman)
 
The Mizuchi is a unique Apparition as it has no unique sound until it has found you, in which case it will scream at you in a woman’s shrieking voice. If you have light sources around you flickering and your heart beat is ringing out, this means that a Mizuchi is nearby. You must get to cover to hide as they can both see and hear you under the right circumstances. 

 
If the Mizuchi  senses a loud enough noise, will borrow underground in which case, it’s presence cannot be heard or even seen at all. Not even your heart beats will go off. They will then emerge from the ground to scare you and chase after you after this occurs. This means that if you are in the clear sometimes, you are not always. 

The best way to deal with a Mizuchi, is to stun them and run into cover, preferably a hiding spot, as fast as possible. If you fear you can’t make it to a hiding spot, stun them and throw fire crackers to avoid being caught and discovered, buying you enough time to make it to safety. 

In Japanese mythology, "mizuchi" (蛟, 虯) refers to a type of aquatic, dragon-like, or serpent-like creature, often associated with water and sometimes considered a water spirit or deity. Which is what this Apparition is based upon. 


### Mechanical Doll 
 
The Mechanical Doll Apparition only appears in The Shrine corridor and they will only begin to wander around or chase after you if you walk into their search lights from their eyes or trigger the map gimmick depending on the difficulty you are playing on. 

 
The Mechanical Doll can be shot and stunned by gunfire but will not make any indication aside from stopping it’s movement that it’s been hit. Additionally, they will not react to the sound of your running but will react to screaming Hanging Men, as well as firecrackers. Which you can use to your advantage to draw them away. If they see you however, they will pursue you at all cost. 
 
### Haikara (Stylish, Megaphone Heads)
 
The first thing you will hear is a type of crazed chattering through a filtered technological wind pipe of some kind. These are the sounds produced through the megaphone. While it is within hearing distance of the player, it will start to build up your “insanity” gauge. Causing major issues if you end up not being able to find cover. As if you scream by becoming “frenzied”, you will be discovered and likely lose a Cande Light (Life Point). 

 
Haikara due to their lack of heads, are considered “blind”, to an extent, in that they won’t usually react to light sources at all. However, they will “see/sense” you if you can be found within a straight line and their ability to sense you will increase if you have light sources up, other then the Butterfly Lantern. 

The Haikara are a type of stylish, Eurocentric Japanese clothing that were popular in the Meiji period ( 1868-1912) of Japanese culture. The Emperor Meiji in Japaense culture is seen as an Emperor that took their traditions and kept the nation as it’s nation and yet still modernized it and embraced some of it’s European traditions as well. In the context of this Apparition, it could mean two possibilities. It could simply be a note of their fancy looking Europeanized clothing, as well as the Apparitions location in “The Glass Building” in normal circumstances, which is a fancy large corridor in itself. Alternatively, it could be a critique on a time in which the Japanese changed drastically and became more Europeanized. Which is a Japanese criticism primarily pointed at Americans, specifically. 

### Mayubo (Cocoon, Baby Faces) 
 
The Mayubo will start attached to a Magatama, like a parasitic organism. It will be inside a large blood red tumor looking growth on the ceiling that is attached to the Magatama. It will not activate and burst out this tumor, unless you pick up the Magatama. This tumor, is likely a “cocoon”, hence, it’s name of Mayubo, which is a name which means “Cocoon” due to the Kanji: 繭
 
Once it has emerged, it will cry loudly with the face of a baby and pursue you. It is a fast Apparition and can instantly break down doors. Your best bet is to have means to stun it such as a gun and then to flee as fast as you can. Once you have escaped it’s range and your heartbeat returns to normal, The Apparition will curl up on the ground, running out of lifeforce and die there. 

 
 



### Trauma
 
The trauma will be heard by it’s crazed loud sounds approaching you, grating and noticeable from far away, it can distinctively be heard louder then any other Apparition in the game. They resemble in some ways, the main player yet appear when the text is displayed that says: “You fell a darkness within you….” While the character looks like themselves, the dress and slight detailed differences, imply that it might instead be that of the “mother” of the main character instead. 

This Apparition is the most deadly in the entire game, as if you barrier it on the higher modes, it will multiply. Yet worse, no matter where you are, even if you hide, it will be able to find you. From the moment it spawns until the very end, it will rush at you from any distance away and pursue you endlessly. The only way to be rid of a Trauma for good, is to use a Two-Hole Candle, costing you a Cande Light (Life Point) to permanently erase them from the level. As if they grab you and take one life themselves, they will still be present and pursue you yet again in your next life. 

If you go to the Butterfly Shop, The Trauma will not follow you. Instead, it will be teleported to the “exit” and await your leaving of the Butterfly Shop. The moment you leave, it will begin it’s pursuit, pathfinding you until it reaches you or is removed. 

Another thing you should never do is use a barrier without a teleport out, as the Trauma will way for you outside. If the barrier room you used only has one way inside, the only way out is through the Trauma, which means losing your Candle Light (Life Point) anyway. 

### Shadow of the True Story (Boss)
 
The Shadow of The True Story, is a godlike entity which is story explained to be your “other half”. An abandoned half that has been left within the realm in which you preside. For this reason, it feels rage toward you due to how long it’s been isolated and left to the corrupting forces that live amongst the realm of the dead. 

The boss only appears on the Missing Windhole level and will pursue the player throughout the level as a chase stage. You will damage it by blowing up or shooting barrels. You can blow up the barrels without shooting them with a pistol by using firecrackers. The Boss must be close enough in range to take the explosion damage, stunning them for a time and allowing you a chance to escape. 

If you try and put a barrier down on the map to block it’s path, it will destroy the barrier and then continue it’s pursuit. If you make it to the end of the level and use the mirror to transport back to an area similar to the start of the level, you will find The Boss will return by seeping out of the ground behind you. The same will occur if you are captured by it and lose a Candle Light (Life Point) in earlier parts of the chase itself. 
 
## Pests
 
Pests are enemies that won’t outright kill you right away but can deal damage to your total health as well as effect various other aspects of your character and the game. While a pest won’t instantly kill you like an Apparition will, if your left in a bad situation, they could be largely responsible for giving you a game over or taking one of your lives. 

Some can seal your karuta, some can slow you down, a pest is “an annoyance” but combined with an apparition together, could result in the loss of your life, or worse, an entire run’s failure if the wrong karuta ends up sealed. 
 


### Pest Types

#### The Hanged Man
 
The Hanged Man can be sticking out of ceiling’s of enclosed buildings in corridors and will then proceed to jumpscare the player, causing great sounds and disturbances and doing damage to what it touches. It will also cause loud amounts of noise which can attract Apparitions 

#### Spiders
 
The Spiders lay webs on the ground waiting for it’s prey to step inside, slowing them down. Apparitions are unaffected by the webs but players will be slowed down extremely and take damage for every second they are within the webs.

#### Human Cocoon Moth
 
Human Cocoon Moth’s like the spiders, lay on top of human cocoon remains amidst the corridors and when triggered by getting to close to them, will chase the player, doing damage to them constantly until they are escaped or a certain amount of time passes. If a player stands still on their cocoon base location, they will take damage until they lose a life or receive a “Game Over”. 

The alternative version of these are the moths which fly in the room of the Cocoon Moth Trap Room which guard a Magatama. 


#### A Glimpse of The Past (Snails)
 
When approached, walked over or scared, The Snails will spew out a purple mist that covers aw ide area of a corridor and will build up the players corruption meter until they escape it’s large purple radius, or they die. The radius bypasses walls and is determined in a circular radius from where the smoke is emitted from.
 
#### Corrupted Humans (Impure) 
 

Corrupted Humans (Impure) will grab the player if contact is made and you will have to hit the button for breaking out repeatedly to get free. They can also end up sealing a karuta at a very high chance if you aren’t lucky. If you shoot one or throw firecrackers at it and have them explode, they will disappear.
  
 
# Magatama Rooms
 
Magatama Rooms are rooms in which you can find Magatama. These rooms are usually behind locked doors, which will require a key to unlock. On higher difficulties, even if taking a Magatama from a room without any traps, the corridor’s effect maybe be triggered on each one’s pick up. Moreover, on deluge, picking up a Magatama will cause an amount of buildup of corruption, which may even kill you if you pick it up and you had enough corruption prior to picking it up. Causing a “Game Over” or loss of a life. 
 
## Standard Room: 
These are standard locked rooms that have a Magatama to be picked up within. Picking up the Magatama will grant you it. 
   


## Hole Room
 
Hole Rooms are locked Magatama Rooms that require a key to unlock. A large hole is in the middle of them that you can fall into. By falling into the hole, you will take health damage similar to trapdoors but instead of being teleported to a location associated with the trapdoor, you will instead be teleported to an area below ground.

 
The Magatama will be on a small alter and behind in the opposite direction will be a mirror. This mirror will not work like The Butterfly Shop mirrors and will instead teleport you to a random location within the level itself. 
 

**Note: If you drop into the hole without 50 health, you will die and lose a life or be given a “Game Over”.**  

## Trap Room
 
Unlike most other Magatama Rooms, Trap Rooms are usually open unless on Deluge difficulty in some instances. You can tell a room is a trap room, based on a red line that will be attached to the Magatama like an umbilical cord. Once the Magatama is taken from this cord in the room, a baby monster apparition will be spawned and chase you down until you lose it or you die, costing you a life or a “Game Over” if you are out of them. These rooms are easy to access but at a very high reward.

## No Noise Shion Trap Rooms
 
In many instances, these rooms will be heard not found right away. The flicker of lights will begin as well as the distinct sound of crying. Usually, this indicates a Shion guarding these rooms and the Magatama which is within the room. These rooms can be locked but there are easy work arounds to this fact. 

By throwing firecrackers, you can draw the slug creature away from the Magatama safely without any major risks. It can also result in the apparition breaking down a locked door and allowing you to safely enter inside. If you try to approach the Magatama without drawing the slug creature away, you will most likely enter up triggering it’s proximity, in which it will never stop chasing you until it has taken a life from you, or caused you to get a “Game Over”. Due to the fact this entity is attracted by footsteps and sounds, it’s sensitivity, dependent on the difficulty you are playing on. 
 
## Swamp Trap Room

Swamp Trap Magatama Rooms are rooms that are entirely covered on the floor in water. Entering the room will cause corruption build up, meaning that you must obtain the Magatama fast and then proceed to leave it with the Magatama obtained. On Deluge, these rooms can be extremely deadly without coffee and karuta card negations for corruption as you’ll build up corruption on your way to the Magatama and then proceed to get hit with further buildup that could push it over the edge to cost a life. 

**Note: Will Get an image of a swamp room that spawns usually in the first level on 2nd highest level or Deluge. Will have to try and get one spawned via Deluge or Time Trial Deluge. Or both.**


## Hanging Man Trap Room
 
Hanging Man Magatama Trap Room’s contain many Hanging Men trap pests which when touched will start to flail around and cause issues for your character and deal damage as well as create loud noises that could attract apparitions. The key to these rooms is to carefully try and traverse them or run through them and trigger a few at a time. Once they are triggered, waiting for them to untrigger and then that area will remain safe while others could be triggered later. 

These rooms can be major drains on your health and should be very carefully treated as they will drain your health fast if not treated with respect and care.  

## Caccoon Moth Trap Room
 
Caccoon Moth’s guard this room and the Magatama within. The only way to obtain it is to take the damage of the room, or to use a fire cracker to scatter the moths, or to use a a star hour glass to freeze time and no damage and run out before it’s time runs out. 
   



# Level Rating and Medals

Upon the completion of the level of a corridor, you will receive a series of medals with a set valuation of points and from those points, be granted a rating. The ratings consist with the medals unlocked and what are obtained as a result. If enough rating is obtained, you will receive Bonus Magatama for purchasing further karuta cards. 

**Will Get image of an aftermath screen with my rating in it. To post at the top of this.**

## Ratings: 

Ratings serve as the game’s “stamp” on your performance and will reward bonuses for high enough ratings. The Ratings brackets are as followed below: 

SS: 24 points or beyond.
S: 15-23 points 
A: 12-14 points
B: 9-11 points. 
C: 6-8 points.
D: 3-5 points. 
E: 2 points and below

SS rating is considered “perfect” and the highest rating you can achieve. E is the lowest, while in practice it is “D” as “E” is extremely hard to obtain in game without trying to obtain it deliberately.

Demonstration: To obtain E Rank, you must  follow these rules.
•	Complete the level AFTER 40 minutes. 
•	Be heard by Apparitions more then two times. 
•	Take 100 Health Damage total. 

And not break more then 2 of these rules: 

o	Complete the level after traveling below 3KM but more then 1KM (1.1KM and above but now anything past 3KM)
o	Eat no more then 4 rice balls or more then 2 popsicles in a row
o	Turn on no more then 19 light sources but having at least one on
o	Consume no passive items 
o	Drive away no more then 2 Impurties (Corrupted Humans)
o	Drive away pests no more then 2 times
o	Stop the Appariton no more then 2 times and same with the pistol
o	Spend no more then 2499 souls at the shop
o	Be killed if you take the Magatama from the Mayubo 
o	Not use firecrackers in a cocoon moth room
o	Use firecrackers to ensure that the Shion goes somewhere in the No Noise Shion Trap Rooms
o	Be discovered before taking a magamata.
o	Do not destroy a door or have an Apparition destroy a locked door. 
o	Do not use trapdoors to make an Apparition fall. 
o	Do not cremate an Apparition with The One Hole Candle. 
o	Do not trap an apparition in a barrier or the Trauma, 
o	Do not escape a wander a single time. 

The above scenario is POSSIBLE… but is more of a challenge, then something likely to occur. 

To see your rating on each difficulty and at each level, on the corridor select menu, look where the letters are circled to see your best results. 
 
 
## Bonus Magatama 

Based on your rating obtained in the level, you will then be granted a set bonus amount of Magatama to be spent for Karuta or anything else you desire. 

SS = 6 Bonus Magatama. 
S = 5 Bonus Magatama.
A = 4 Bonus Magatama
B = 3 Bonus Magatama
C = 2 Bonus Magatama
D = 1 Bonus Magatama
E = 0 Bonus Magatama
 
# Archives (Collectible Documents) 

Archives are documents that can be collected throughout your explorations that contain information and lore about various aspects of the world in which you find yourself in. They are usually discovered in drawers while searching for items or can be bought at The Butterfly Shop.
 

 

# Magamata Challenge
 
The Magamata Challenge is unlocked after completing the entire story fully on any difficulty. The goal of the mode is to grab as many Magamata as fast as possible within the time limit. You start with 5 minutes and every time you obtain a Magamata you are given an additional minute for your run time. Focusing on speed as such, is essential. 

Every 3 Magamata you obtain will grant you with a trophy in the following bracket: 

•	Gold Trophy: 9
•	Silver Trophy: 6
•	Bronze Trophy: 3

The map is 4 x 4 and in total there are 16 magatama generated at once to collect. Health and lives (Candle Lights) still count in this mode, however, you don’t take a direct time penalty for losing a life, aside from the death and respawn animation time itself to the timer. 
Item appearance rates are based on beginner mode.

The conditions for activating the map gimmick when obtaining the magatama are the same as in advanced mode but the range of effect of the gimmick are those of intermediate mode.

The enemy's performance is based on intermediate level and play at that level as a result. However, the trauma will spawn on any map regardless of it’s gimmick, after a 9th magamata is obtained and it will multiply if put in a barrier just like in Advanced mode. 
 
 
# Marathon Mode
 
To unlock Marathon Mode, you must fully complete the story of the game once and in doing so, will unlock this mode. 

In Marathon Mode, you start on the first level at the difficulty of your choice and play from start to finish. If you quit mid marathon run on the pause menu, resuming will bring the player back to the start of the corridor they were running when they return. This also allows you to change karuta for each individual map for optimal play, as well as coffee effects. If a Game over is obtained, the Marathon is considered “over” and you must start all over again. 

Souls and items carry over from one corridor into the next, so exploring a corridor for longer periods of time to prepare for a next one, might be a possible play to make. 



At the end of your Marathon (if you make it that far-), your total time is totaled up and scored accordingly.
